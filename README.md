# Touch Dashboard

This is just a small project to play around with some experimental UI stuff on
large form factor (~23 inch) touch screen devices in Chrome/Chromium.

The end goal will be for the dashboard to be permanently displayed on a
touch screen with easy access.

... and yes... the style is TRON inspired... don't judge!
